you’d have done
 …
He got to his feet and stretched. Aunt Petunia and
Uncle V
ernon seemed to feel that whenever Dudley
turned up was the right time to be home, and anytime
after that was much too late. Uncle V
ernon had
threatened to lock Harry in the shed if he came home
after Dudley again, so, stifling a yawn, still scowling,
Harry set of
f toward the park gate.
Magnolia Road, like Privet Drive, was full of lar
ge,
square houses with perfectly manicured lawns, all
owned by lar
ge, square owners who drove very clean
cars similar to Uncle V
ernon’
s. Harry preferred Little
Whinging by night, when the curtained windows
made patches of jewel-bright colors in the darkness
and he ran no danger of hearing disapproving
mutters about his “delinquent” appearance when he
passed the householders. He walked quickly
, so that
halfway along Magnolia Road Dudley’
s gang came into
view again; they were saying their farewells at the
www.ztcprep.com

entrance to Magnolia Crescent. Harry stepped into
the shadow of a lar
ge lilac tree and waited.

“… squealed like a pig, didn’
t he?” Malcolm was
saying, to guf
faws from the others.
“Nice right hook, Big D,” said Piers.
“Same time tomorrow?” said Dudley
.
“Round at my place, my parents are out,” said
Gordon.
“See you then,” said Dudley
.
“Bye Dud!”
“See ya, Big D!”
Harry waited for the rest of the gang to move on
before setting of
f again. When their voices had faded
once more he headed around the corner into Magnolia
Crescent and by walking very quickly he soon came
within hailing distance of Dudley
, who was strolling
along at his ease, humming tunelessly
.
“Hey
, Big D!”
Dudley turned.
www.ztcprep.com

“Oh,” he grunted. “It’
s you.”
“How long have you been ‘Big D’ then?” said Harry
.
“Shut it,” snarled Dudley
, turning away again.
“Cool name,” said Harry
, grinning and falling into
step beside his cousin. “But you’ll always be Ickle
Diddykins to me.”
“I said, SHUT IT!” said Dudley
, whose ham-like hands
had curled into fists.

“Don’
t the boys know that’
s what your mum calls
you?”
“Shut your face.”
“Y
ou don’
t tell 
her
 to shut her face. What about
‘popkin’ and ‘Dinky Diddydums,’ can I use them
then?”
Dudley said nothing. The ef
fort of keeping himself
from hitting Harry seemed to be demanding all his
self-control.
“So who’ve you been beating up tonight?” Harry
asked, his grin fading. “Another ten-year
-old? I know
www.ztcprep.com

you did Mark Evans two nights ago —”
“He was asking for it,” snarled Dudley
.
“Oh yeah?”
“He cheeked me.”
“Y
eah? Did he say you look like a pig that’
s been
taught to walk on its hind legs? ’Cause that’
s not
cheek, Dud, that’
s true …”
A muscle was twitching in Dudley’
s jaw
. It gave Harry
enormous satisfaction to know how furious he was
making Dudley; he felt as though he was siphoning
of
f his own frustration into his cousin, the only outlet
he had.
They turned right down the narrow alleyway where
Harry had first seen Sirius and which formed a
shortcut between Magnolia Crescent and W
isteria
W
alk. It was empty and much darker than the streets
it linked because there were no streetlamps. Their

side and a high fence on the other

“Think you’re a big man carrying that thing, don’
t
you?” Dudley said after a few seconds.
“What thing?”
“That — that thing you’re hiding.”
Harry grinned again.
“Not as stupid as you look, are you, Dud? But I s’pose
if you were, you wouldn’
t be able to walk and talk at
the same time...”
Harry pulled out his wand. He saw Dudley look
sideways at it.
“Y
ou’re not allowed,” Dudley said at once. “I know
you’re not. Y
ou’d get expelled from that freak school
you go to.”
“How d’you know they haven’
t changed the rules, Big
D?”
“They haven’
t,” said Dudley
, though he didn’
t sound
completely convinced. Harry laughed softly
.
“Y
ou haven’
t got the guts to take me on without that
thing, have you?” Dudley snarled.
“Whereas you just need four mates behind you before

you can beat up a ten-year
-old. Y
ou know that boxing
title you keep banging on about? How old was your
opponent? Seven? Eight?”
“He was sixteen for your information,” snarled
Dudley
, “and he was out cold for twenty minutes after

I’d finished with him and he was twice as heavy as

“Running to Daddy now
, are you? Is his ickle boxing
champ frightened of nasty Harry’
s wand?”
“Not this brave at night, are you?” sneered Dudley
.
“This 
is
 night, Diddykins. That’
s what we call it when
it goes all dark like this.”
“I mean when you’re in bed!” Dudley snarled.
He had stopped walking. Harry stopped too, staring at
his cousin. From the little he could see of Dudley’
s
lar
ge face, he was wearing a strangely triumphant
look.
“What d’you mean, I’m not brave in bed?” said Harry
,
www.ztcprep.com

completely nonplussed. “What — am I supposed to be
frightened of pillows or something?”
“I heard you last night,” said Dudley breathlessly
.
“T
alking in your sleep. 
Moaning
.”
“What d’you mean?” Harry said again, but there was
a cold, plunging sensation in his stomach. He had
revisited the graveyard last night in his dreams.
Dudley gave a harsh bark of laughter then adopted a
high-pitched, whimpering voice. “ ‘Don’
t kill Cedric!
Don’
t kill Cedric!’ Who’
s Cedric — your boyfriend?”
“I — you’re lying —” said Harry automatically
. But his
mouth had gone dry
. He knew Dudley wasn’
t lying —
how else would he know about Cedric?

“ ‘Dad! Help me, Dad! He’
s going to kill me, Dad! Boo-
hoo!’ ”
“Shut up,” said Harry quietly
. “Shut up, Dudley
, I’m
warning you!”
“ ‘Come and help me, Dad! Mum, come and help me!

Don’
t you point that thing at me
!”
Dudley backed into the alley wall. Harry was pointing
the wand directly at Dudley’
s heart. Harry could feel
fourteen years’ hatred of Dudley pounding in his
veins — what wouldn’
t he give to strike now
, to jinx
Dudley so thoroughly he’d have to crawl home like an
insect, struck dumb, sprouting feelers —
“Don’
t ever talk about that again,” Harry snarled.
“D’you understand me?”
“Point that thing somewhere else!”
“I said, 
do you understand me
?”
“
Point it somewher
e else
!”
“DO YOU UNDERST
AND ME?”
“GET THA
T THING A
W
A
Y FROM —”
Dudley gave an odd, shuddering gasp, as though he
had been doused in icy water
.
Something had happened to the night. The star
-
strewn indigo sky was suddenly pitch-black and
lightless — the stars, the moon, the misty streetlamps
at either end of the alley had vanished. The distant
www.ztcprep.com

grumble of cars and the whisper of trees had gone.
The balmy evening was suddenly piercingly
, bitingly
P a g e

cold. They were surrounded by total, impenetrable,
silent darkness, as though some giant hand had
dropped a thick, icy mantle over the entire alleyway
,
blinding them.
For a split second Harry thought he had done magic
without meaning to, despite the fact that he’d been
resisting as hard as he could — then his reason
caught up with his senses — he didn’
t have the power
to turn of
f the stars. He turned his head this way and
that, trying to see something, but the darkness
pressed on his eyes like a weightless veil.
Dudley’
s terrified voice broke in Harry’
s ear
.
“W
-what are you d-doing? St-stop it!”
“I’m not doing anything! Shut up and don’
t move!”
“I c-can’
t see! I’ve g-gone blind! I —”
“I said shut up!”
Harry stood stock-still, turning his sightless eyes left
www.ztcprep.com

and right. The cold was so intense that he was
shivering all over; goose bumps had erupted up his
arms, and the hairs on the back of his neck were
standing up — he opened his eyes to their fullest
extent, staring blankly around, unseeing …
It was impossible... They couldn’
t be here... Not in
Little Whinging … He strained his ears... He would
hear them before he saw them...
“I’ll t-tell Dad!” Dudley whimpered. “W
-where are you?
What are you d-do — ?”
“W
ill you shut up?” Harry hissed, “I’m trying to lis —”

But he fell silent. He had heard just the thing he had been dreading.
There was something in the alleyway apart from
themselves, something that was drawing long, hoarse,
rattling breaths. Harry felt a horrible jolt of dread as
he stood trembling in the freezing air
.
“C-cut it out! Stop doing it! I’ll h-hit you, I swear I
will!”
“Dudley
, shut —”
www.ztcprep.com

WHAM
!
A fist made contact with the side of Harry’
s head,
lifting Harry of
f his feet. Small white lights popped in
front of Harry’
s eyes; for the second time in an hour
he felt as though his head had been cleaved in two;
next moment he had landed hard on the ground, and
his wand had flown out of his hand.
“Y
ou moron, Dudley!” Harry yelled, his eyes watering
with pain, as he scrambled to his hands and knees,
now feeling around frantically in the blackness. He
heard Dudley blundering away
, hitting the alley fence,
stumbling.
“DUDLEY
, COME BACK! YOU’RE RUNNING RIGHT
A
T IT!”
There was a horrible squealing yell, and Dudley’
s
footsteps stopped. At the same moment, Harry felt a
creeping chill behind him that could mean only one
thing. There was more than one.
“DUDLEY
, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT! WHA
TEVER
YOU DO, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT! W
