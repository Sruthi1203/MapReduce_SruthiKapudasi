.”
“How’re we getting — wherever we’re going?” Harry
asked.
“Brooms,” said Lupin. “Only way
. Y
ou’re too young to
Apparate, they’ll be watching the Floo Network, and
it’
s more than our life’
s worth to set up an
unauthorized Portkey
.”
“Remus says you’re a good flier
,” said Kingsley
Shacklebolt in his deep voice.
“He’
s excellent,” said Lupin, who was checking his
watch. “Anyway
, you’d better go and get packed,
Harry
, we want to be ready to go when the signal
comes.”
“I’ll come and help you,” said T
onks brightly
.
She followed Harry back into the hall and up the
stairs, looking around with much curiosity and
interest.
“Funny place,” she said, “it’
s a bit 
too
 clean, d’you
know what I mean? Bit unnatural. Oh, this is better
,”
she added, as they entered Harry’
s bedroom and he

turned on the light.
His room was certainly much messier than the rest of
the house. Confined to it for four days in a very bad
mood, Harry had not bothered tidying up after
himself. Most of the books he owned were strewn over
the floor where he’d tried to distract himself with each
in turn and thrown it aside. Hedwig’
s cage needed
cleaning out and was starting to smell, and his trunk
lay open, revealing a jumbled mixture of Muggle

clothes and wizard’
s robes that had spilled onto the
floor around it.
Harry started picking up books and throwing them
hastily into his trunk. T
onks paused at his open
wardrobe to look critically at her reflection in the
mirror on the inside of the door
.
“Y
ou know
, I don’
t think purple’
s really my color
,” she
said pensively
, tugging at a lock of spiky hair
. “D’you
think it makes me look a bit peaky?”
“Er —” said Harry
, looking up at her over the top of

.
“Y
eah, it does,” said T
onks decisively
. She screwed up
her eyes in a strained expression as though she were
struggling to remember something. A second later
,
her hair had turned bubble-gum pink.
“How did you do that?” said Harry
, gaping at her as
she opened her eyes again.
“I’m a Metamorphmagus,” she said, looking back at
her reflection and turning her head so that she could
see her hair from all directions. “It means I can
change my appearance at will,” she added, spotting
Harry’
s puzzled expression in the mirror behind her
.
“I was born one. I got top marks in Concealment and
Disguise during Auror training without any study at
all, it was great.”
“Y
ou’re an Auror?” said Harry
, impressed. Being a
Dark wizard catcher was the only career he’d ever
considered after Hogwarts.
“Y
eah,” said T
onks, looking proud. “Kingsley is as
well; he’
s a bit higher up than I am, though. I only

racking, I’m dead clumsy
, did you hear me break
that plate when we arrived downstairs?”
“Can you learn how to be a Metamorphmagus?” Harry
asked her
, straightening up, completely for
getting
about packing.
T
onks chuckled.
“Bet you wouldn’
t mind hiding that scar sometimes,
eh?”
Her eyes found the lightning-shaped scar on Harry’
s
forehead.
“No, I wouldn’
t mind,” Harry mumbled, turning away
.
He did not like people staring at his scar
.
“W
ell, you’ll have to learn the hard way
, I’m afraid,”
said T
onks. “Metamorphmagi are really rare, they’re
born, not made. Most wizards need to use a wand or
potions to change their appearance... But we’ve got to
get going, Harry
, we’re supposed to be packing,” she
added guiltily
, looking around at all the mess on the
www.ztcprep.com

floor
.
“Oh — yeah,” said Harry
, grabbing up a few more
books.
“Don’
t be stupid, it’ll be much quicker if I — 
pack
!”
cried T
onks, waving her wand in a long, sweeping
movement over the floor
.
Books, clothes, telescope, and scales all soared into
the air and flew pell-mell into the trunk.
“It’
s not very neat,” said T
onks, walking over to the
trunk and looking down at the jumble inside. “My
mum’
s got this knack of getting stuf
f to fit itself in

neatly — she even gets the socks to fold themselves —
but I’ve never mastered how she does it — it’
s a kind
of flick —”
She flicked her wand hopefully; one of Harry’
s socks
gave a feeble sort of wiggle and flopped back on top of
the mess within.
“Ah, well,” said T
onks, slamming the trunk’
s lid shut,
“at least it’
s all in. That could do with a bit of
www.ztcprep.com

cleaning, too — 
Scour

 —” She pointed her wand at
Hedwig’
s cage; a few feathers and droppings
vanished. “W
ell, that’
s a 
bit
 better — I’ve never quite
got the hang of these sort of householdy spells. Right
— got everything? Cauldron? Broom? W
ow! A
Fir
ebolt
?”
Her eyes widened as they fell on the broomstick in
Harry’
s right hand. It was his pride and joy
, a gift
from Sirius, an international standard broomstick.
“And I’m still riding a Comet T
wo Sixty
,” said T
onks
enviously
. “Ah well … wand still in your jeans? Both
buttocks still on? Okay
, let’
s go. 
Locomotor T
runk. 
”
Harry’
s trunk rose a few inches into the air
. Holding
her wand like a conductor
’
s baton, T
onks made it
hover across the room and out of the door ahead of
them, Hedwig’
s cage in her left hand. Harry followed
her down the stairs carrying his broomstick.
Back in the kitchen, Moody had replaced his eye,
which was spinning so fast after its cleaning it made
Harry feel sick. Kingsley Shacklebolt and Stur

across while rummaging in the drawers. Lupin was
sealing a letter addressed to the Dursleys.

“Excellent,” said Lupin, looking up as T
onks and
Harry entered. “W
e’ve got about a minute, I think. W
e
should probably get out into the garden so we’re
ready
. Harry
, I’ve left a letter telling your aunt and
uncle not to worry —”
“They won’
t,” said Harry
.
“That you’re safe —”
“That’ll just depress them.”
“— and you’ll see them next summer
.”
“Do I have to?”
Lupin smiled but made no answer
.
“Come here, boy
,” said Moody gruf
fly
, beckoning
Harry toward him with his wand. “I need to
Disillusion you.”
“Y
ou need to what?” said Harry nervously
.

“Disillusionment Charm,” said Moody
, raising his
wand. “Lupin says you’ve got an Invisibility Cloak,
but it won’
t stay on while we’re flying; this’ll disguise
you better
. Here you go —”
He rapped Harry hard on the top of the head and
Harry felt a curious sensation as though Moody had
just smashed an egg there; cold trickles seemed to be
running down his body from the point the wand had
struck.

Harry looked down at his body
, or rather
, what had
been his body
, for it didn’
t look anything like his
anymore. It was not invisible; it had simply taken on
the exact color and texture of the kitchen unit behind
him. He seemed to have become a human chameleon.
“Come on,” said Moody
, unlocking the back door with
his wand.
They all stepped outside onto Uncle V
ernon’
s
beautifully kept lawn.
“Clear night,” grunted Moody
, his magical eye
scanning the heavens. “Could’ve done with a bit more
cloud cover
. Right, you,” he barked at Harry
, “we’re
going to be flying in close formation. T
onks’ll be right
in front of you, keep close on her tail. Lupin’ll be
covering you from below
. I’m going to be behind you.
The rest’ll be circling us. W
e don’
t break ranks for
anything, got me? If one of us is killed —”
www.ztcprep.com

“Is that likely?” Harry asked apprehensively
, but
Moody ignored him.
“— the others keep flying, don’
t stop, don’
t break
ranks. If they take out all of us and you survive,
Harry
, the rear guard are standing by to take over;
keep flying east and they’ll join you.”
“Stop being so cheerful, Mad-Eye, he’ll think we’re not
taking this seriously
,” said T
onks, as she strapped
Harry’
s trunk and Hedwig’
s cage into a harness
hanging from her broom.
“I’m just telling the boy the plan,” growled Moody
.
“Our job’
s to deliver him safely to headquarters and if
we die in the attempt —”

“No one’
s going to die,” said Kingsley Shacklebolt in
his deep, calming voice.
“Mount your brooms, that’
s the first signal!” said
Lupin sharply
, pointing into the sky
.
Far
, far above them, a shower of bright red sparks
had flared among the stars. Harry recognized them at
www.ztcprep.com

once as wand sparks. He swung his right leg over his
Firebolt, gripped its handle tightly
, and felt it
vibrating very slightly
, as though it was as keen as he
was to be up in the air once more.
“Second signal, let’
s go!” said Lupin loudly
, as more
sparks, green this time, exploded high above them.
Harry kicked of
f hard from the ground. The cool night
air rushed through his hair as the neat square
gardens of Privet Drive fell away
, shrinking rapidly
into a patchwork of dark greens and blacks, and
every thought of the Ministry hearing was swept from
his mind as though the rush of air had blown it out of
his head. He felt as though his heart was going to
explode with pleasure; he was flying again, flying
away from Privet Drive as he’d been fantasizing about
all summer
, he was going home... For a few glorious
moments, all his problems seemed to recede into
nothing, insignificant in the vast, starry sky
.
“Hard left, hard left, there’
s a Muggle looking up!”
shouted Moody from behind him. T
